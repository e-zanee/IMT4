<p class="margin-bottom-none"><strong>Musical career</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since 2016 Hahn has piloted free concerts for parents with infants, a knitting circle, a community dance workshop, a yoga class, and art students. She plans to continue these community-oriented concerts, encouraging people to combine live performance with their interests outside the concert hall and providing opportunities for parents to hear music with their infants, who might be barred from traditional concerts.</p>

<p>In 2020, Hahn and AI roboticist and tech entrepreneur&nbsp;Carol E. Reiley&nbsp;cofounded DeepMusic.ai to work with artists and AI companies to amplify human creativity.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-none"><strong>Instrument</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her violin is an 1864 copy of Paganini's&nbsp;<em>Cannone</em>&nbsp;made by&nbsp;Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume.&nbsp;In an interview on Danish television Hahn said she almost never leaves her instrument out of sight. She uses bows by American bow maker Isaac Salchow&nbsp;and French bow makers Émile Ouchard, Paul Jombar, and Emil Miquel. For her strings, she uses&nbsp;Thomastik-Infeld&nbsp;Dominants for the A (aluminum wound), D and G (silver wound) and a Pirastro Gold Label Steel E.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hahn has also acquired a second Vuillaume, an 1865 model loosely based on the&nbsp;1715 Alard Stradivarius, and has used both in recent years for recording and performing.</p>
